## 

I earned a PhD in Economics from the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC)-Spain. I also holds a Masters in Economics from the ULPGC and I am a Mechanical-Electrical Engineer from the Universidad de Piura (UDEP)-Peru. I received the Robert S. McNamara Fellowship from the World Bank Institute, which allowed me to finish my doctoral thesis during a research stay at the ULPGC. 

My main research areas are the economics of energy markets, macroeconomics, applied mathematics to economics, and social sciences. Recently, I have published academic articles in journals such as Energy Strategy Reviews, The Electricity Journal, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, International Journal of Differential Equations, and Economies. I have contributed to scientific research conferences (in person, virtual, and posters) organized by prestigious institutions in Spain, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Moreover, I have published textbooks on dynamic macroeconomics and dynamical systems for economists. 

I have taught at the UDEP, Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo (USAT), Universidad ESAN, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas (UPC), Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola (USIL), among other higher education institutions. I have served as the director of Research at USAT and Head of the Academic Department of the Faculty of Business Administration (USAT). I was the former Director of Research at the Universidad Autónoma del Perú (UA) and past Dean of the Faculty of Business Sciences at USIL. Also, I was a research professor at USIL in the Faculty of Business Sciences. 

I am Certified as a Researcher in Science and Technology by the National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CONCYTEC) of Peru. I am a member of the International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) and the American Economic Association (AEA).
